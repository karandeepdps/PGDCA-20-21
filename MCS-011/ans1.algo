#Algorithm
#1. Start
#2. Read one number a
#3. Store the remainder when the number a is divided by 16 in a temporary variable temp. If temp is less than 10, insert (48 + temp) in a character array otherwise if temp is greater than or equals to 10, insert (55 + temp) in the character array.
#4. Divide the number a by 16 now
#5.Repeat the above two steps until the number a is not equal to 0
#6.Print the array in reverse order now.
#7.Stop.
